# Sifting Fly

Sifting Fly is a quick example of how to include the power of [Sift Ninja's](https://www.siftninja.com) smart content filtering with Flybase.

This is a basic chat app, nothing gets stored in your database, it's just using custom events to output what gets typed, and if what gets typed fails Sift Ninja's results, then you get an error telling you that.

This can be easily adapted for other chat systems without much work, but I wanted to demonstrate how to use it here.
